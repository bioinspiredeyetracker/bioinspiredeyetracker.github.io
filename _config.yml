  Group 17: Bio-Inspired Eye Tracker
  
  Problem Statement:
  Despite the fact that marmosets are one of the most common primates utilized in neuroscience studies, there is currently not a low weight, compact eye-tracking system that can be used for research involving quick-moving, unconstrained marmosets. Large and heavy systems may create stress and physiological damage for the monkeys, which is highly unethical. With a lower weight system, the marmosets will be able to wear the device for longer periods of time; thus, allowing for a more efficient collection of their eye gaze data. Current systems of tracking marmoset gaze are either not power-efficient, resulting in shorter experiments and less data acquisition, or too large for the marmosets to carry and move around, reducing the accuracy of data acquired from marmosets interacting with their environments. A further aspect of this problem is ensuring that the eye tracking data can be analyzed in a reliable, user-friendly manner. Although many current eye-tracking systems output videos taken from a standard camera onto an SD card or use other means, these large video files may be difficult to analyze in a meaningful way.
 # Moonwalk is a fast and elegant Jekyll theme with a clean dark mode. It comes with horizontal list (for navbar and footer), card list (for portfolio), and a generic vertical list. It is very easy to modify in case you want to build over it - please see _layouts/home.html to do that.
