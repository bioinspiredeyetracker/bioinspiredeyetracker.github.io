**Objective:** 
The objective of developing a mechanical design for a new marmoset backpack was to consolidate all the components of the qDVS hardware into one wearable system that is lightweight and modular.

This design is meant to be as light weight as possible, with cutouts placed strategically throughout to allow for a lightweight yet sturdy enclosure. The backpack incorporates an arched piece that is meant to hug the back of the marmoset for comfortable wear, allowing for longer experiment times and improved biocompatibility. 

**Future Directions:**
Future teams that may choose to work on this project will have access to these SolidWorks files and will be able to update the design of the backpack to accomodate for PCB re-design. The proof-of-concept PCB schematics provided by our team can be used to develop a shrunken down version of the qDVS, and can be incorporated in this backpack design. Dimensions should be easy to modify as it is all consolidated in a SolidWorks assembly. Please reach out to any of us if you are a prospective future design team member!
